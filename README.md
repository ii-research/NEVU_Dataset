## Paper

NEVU is introduced in the following paper:

**Event-Centric Human Value Understanding in News-Domain Texts: An Actor-Conditioned Benchmark across Multi-Scope Event Contexts**

# NEVU Public Temporary Release

This is a temporary public release of the NEVU dataset for human value understanding in news-domain texts.

## Important Note

A portion of the full dataset is currently reserved for an ongoing protected blind evaluation and is therefore excluded from this release to avoid evaluation leakage.

* Protected GUIDs: 350
* Complete protected materials are planned to be released after the blind evaluation period ends in **January 2027**.

All released files in this repository have been filtered at the GUID level to remove protected instances where applicable.

## Files

The current release is organized into the following directories:

    ...
```

The underlying data formats and field definitions remain unchanged. The release organization additionally provides explicit train/dev/test event-base files aligned with the corresponding human-value annotation partitions.

### `event_base/`

The `event_base/` directory contains both the unified event-base collection and explicit train/dev/test event-base files.

The unified files are:

* `event_base/event_base.json`
* `event_base/event_base_reformatted.json`

These files contain all currently shareable event-base records in a single collection.

For convenience and direct alignment with the released NEVU partitions, the same event-base records are additionally divided into:

* `event_base/train/`
* `event_base/dev/`
* `event_base/test/`

The partitioned files are:

* `event_base/train/train_event_base.json`
* `event_base/train/train_event_base_reformatted.json`
* `event_base/dev/dev_event_base.json`
* `event_base/dev/dev_event_base_reformatted.json`
* `event_base/test/test_event_base.json`
* `event_base/test/test_event_base_reformatted.json`

The train/dev/test assignment of event records follows the GUID-based partition membership defined by the corresponding full human-value annotation partitions under `total/`. No event structure is changed during this partitioning process.

Thus, users may either work with the unified event-base files or directly use the partition-specific event-base files together with the corresponding annotation files.

### `total/`

The `total/` directory contains the currently shareable human-value annotations corresponding to the `Total` subsets reported in the paper.

The annotations are separated into the official:

* train partition
* dev partition
* test partition

All protected GUIDs and their corresponding annotations have been removed from the released files.

The train/dev/test GUID assignments in `total/` are also used to construct the corresponding partition-specific event-base files under `event_base/train/`, `event_base/dev/`, and `event_base/test/`.

### `sub/`

The `sub/` directory contains the currently shareable human-value annotations corresponding to the fixed sampled `Sub` subsets reported in the paper. The annotations are organized into train, dev, and test partitions.

The current public files exclude protected GUIDs and contain the released portions of the sampled subsets used in the reported experiments.

The event-base train/dev/test files are defined according to the full partition assignments under `total/`, rather than independently from the sampled `sub/` subsets. Users working with `sub/` can retrieve the corresponding event record through the shared `guid`.

### `majority-accepted_subset/`

The file:

* `majority-accepted_subset_without_blind_data.json`

contains the currently shareable majority-accepted reference labels derived from the multi-group candidate-acceptance assessment reported in the paper.

The complete majority-accepted reference subset contains 400 evaluated unit--actor pairs covering 187 unique GUIDs. Four GUIDs overlap with the protected blind-evaluation set and are removed from the current public file.

The complete majority-accepted reference subset will be released after the blind evaluation period ends in January 2027.

### `hv_framework/`

The `hv_framework/` directory is unchanged from the previous release.

## File Descriptions

The field definitions below apply across the corresponding train/dev/test files in both `total/` and `sub/`.

For example:

* `total/train_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `total/dev_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `total/test_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `sub/train_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `sub/dev_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `sub/test_human_value_labels_2ids.json`

all follow the same schema described for `human_value_labels_2ids.json` below.

The same principle applies to the human-readable and reformatted versions.

### 1. `event_base/event_base.json`

This file contains the unified event-structured base data for the currently shareable news articles. Each record corresponds to one article and includes the article text, title, time, actor information, sentence list, and event-centric semantic structures.

Main fields include:

* `guid`: unique article identifier
* `title`: article title
* `content`: raw article text
* `time`: publication date or time information
* `actors`: normalized major social actors appearing in the article
* `sentences`: sentence-level segmented article content
* `subevents`: fine-grained local event units grounded to sentence IDs
* `behaviors`: behavior-based event chains
* `story_narratives`: higher-level narrative groupings over subevents
* `news_type_l1`: coarse news genre label

This file is the structural foundation of the dataset and is used to represent each article as a multi-level event-centric semantic unit.

The same released event-base records are also provided as explicit train/dev/test files under:

* `event_base/train/`
* `event_base/dev/`
* `event_base/test/`

These partition-specific files preserve the original event-base structure and are constructed solely according to the GUID membership of the corresponding full annotation partitions under `total/`.

### 1b. `event_base/event_base_reformatted.json`

This file is a reformatted version of `event_base.json` with more standardized field organization.

Compared with the original version:

* `behaviors` is renamed to `bces`
* `story_narratives` is renamed to `sces`
* each bce entry is explicitly structured with:

  * `unit_id`
  * `bce_title`
  * `behaviors`

For each bce entry:

* `unit_id` is the list of behavior IDs contained in that bce
* `bce_title` is the original behavior-chain title
* `behaviors` contains the original behavior items grouped under that bce

In this reformatted version:

* `bces` correspond to the original `behavior_chains`
* `sces` correspond to the original `story_narratives`

This file is recommended for users who want a cleaner and more uniform event structure for parsing, modeling, or cross-level processing.

The corresponding train/dev/test versions are provided as:

* `event_base/train/train_event_base_reformatted.json`
* `event_base/dev/dev_event_base_reformatted.json`
* `event_base/test/test_event_base_reformatted.json`

They contain the same reformatted event representation, partitioned solely by `guid`.

### 2. `*_human_value_labels_2ids.json`

These files contain the released human value labels in a compact ID-based format. Each record corresponds to one annotated `(unit, actor)` instance.

Main fields include:

* `guid`: article identifier
* `unit_level`: semantic level of the annotation (`article`, `subevent`, `bce`, or `sce`)
* `unit_id`: ID of the target unit within the article
* `actor`: target actor ID
* `aligned`: list of aligned human value IDs
* `contradictory`: list of contradictory human value IDs

Because one article may contain multiple annotated units and multiple actors, these files are expanded: a single `guid` may appear in many rows.

These files are suitable for benchmark training and evaluation, since they provide the released reference labels in a compact machine-readable format.

The same schema is used for:

* `total/train_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `total/dev_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `total/test_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `sub/train_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `sub/dev_human_value_labels_2ids.json`
* `sub/test_human_value_labels_2ids.json`

### 2b. `*_human_value_labels_2ids_reformatted.json`

These files are reformatted versions of the corresponding `*_human_value_labels_2ids.json` files.

Compared with the original version:

* unit types are normalized to `article`, `subevent`, `bce`, and `sce`
* `bce` corresponds to the original `behavior_chains`
* `sce` corresponds to the original `story_narratives`
* the original value labels are reorganized into two explicit levels:

  * `l1_label`
  * `l2_label`

Main fields include:

* `guid`: article identifier
* `unit_level`: semantic level of the annotation (`article`, `subevent`, `bce`, or `sce`)
* `unit_id`: ID of the target unit within the article
* `actor`: target actor
* `l1_label`:

  * `aligned`: list of aligned Level-1 value IDs
  * `contradictory`: list of contradictory Level-1 value IDs
* `l2_label`:

  * `aligned`: list of aligned Level-2 value IDs
  * `contradictory`: list of contradictory Level-2 value IDs

These files are recommended for users who want a more explicit hierarchical label structure while preserving the compact machine-readable format.

The same schema is used for the train/dev/test files under both `total/` and `sub/`.

### 3. `*_human_value_labels.json`

These files contain the human value annotations in a richer, more interpretable format. Each record corresponds to one article and groups value annotations by semantic level.

Main sections include:

* `article_human_values`
* `subevents_human_values`
* `behavior_chains_human_values`
* `story_narrative_human_values`

Within each section, annotations are organized by actor and direction:

* `aligned_with_human_values`
* `contradictory_to_human_values`

For each value label, the public release retains:

* `confidence`
* `explanation`

Fields such as `model`, `qa_results`, `human_voting_count`, and `human_voting_num` are not included in the public release.

These files are useful for interpretation, qualitative analysis, and understanding why a particular human value label was assigned.

The same schema is used for:

* `total/train_human_value_labels.json`
* `total/dev_human_value_labels.json`
* `total/test_human_value_labels.json`
* `sub/train_human_value_labels.json`
* `sub/dev_human_value_labels.json`
* `sub/test_human_value_labels.json`

### 3b. `*_human_value_labels_reformatted.json`

These files are reformatted versions of the corresponding `*_human_value_labels.json` files in a flatter and more instance-oriented format.

Each record corresponds to one `(guid, unit_level, unit_id, actor)` instance and groups all associated human values under that instance.

Main fields include:

* `guid`: article identifier
* `unit_level`: semantic level of the annotation (`article`, `subevent`, `bce`, or `sce`)
* `unit_id`: ID of the target unit
* `actor`: target actor
* `human_values`: list of value entries

Each value entry includes:

* `l1_label`: Level-1 value label
* `l2_label`: corresponding Level-2 value label
* `confidence`: retained confidence score
* `explanation`: retained explanation text
* `direction`: `aligned` or `contra`

For reformatted unit identifiers:

* for `article`, `unit_id` is empty
* for `subevent`, `unit_id` is the `subevent_id`
* for `sce`, `unit_id` is the `story_narrative_id`
* for `bce`, `unit_id` is the list of IDs in `behavior_ids_chains`

These files are useful for easier programmatic loading, actor-centered inspection, and modeling pipelines that prefer flatter structures.

The same schema is used for the train/dev/test files under both `total/` and `sub/`.

## Relationship Between the Main Files

All files are aligned through the `guid` field.

### Event structure

The complete currently shareable event-base collection is available in:

* `event_base/event_base.json`
* `event_base/event_base_reformatted.json`

For direct split-wise use, the same event records are additionally organized into:

* `event_base/train/`
* `event_base/dev/`
* `event_base/test/`

The partition-specific event-base files follow the same train/dev/test GUID assignments as the corresponding full human-value annotation files under `total/`.

### Total human-value annotations

Files under `total/` provide the currently shareable annotations from the complete NEVU train/dev/test partitions after protected-GUID filtering.

For example:

* `total/train_human_value_labels_2ids.json` aligns with `event_base/train/train_event_base.json`
* `total/dev_human_value_labels_2ids.json` aligns with `event_base/dev/dev_event_base.json`
* `total/test_human_value_labels_2ids.json` aligns with `event_base/test/test_event_base.json`

The same relationship applies to the reformatted versions.

### Sampled human-value annotations

Files under `sub/` provide the currently shareable portions of the fixed sampled subsets used for the main HVR experiments.

The sampled annotation subsets do not define a separate event-base partition. Their corresponding event records can be retrieved either from the unified event-base files or from the appropriate train/dev/test event-base file using `guid`.

### Majority-accepted reference labels

* `majority-accepted_subset/majority-accepted_subset_without_blind_data.json` provides the currently shareable portion of the majority-accepted reference subset.

In other words:

* use the unified `event_base/event_base.json` or `event_base/event_base_reformatted.json` when a single event collection is preferred,
* use the files under `event_base/train/`, `event_base/dev/`, and `event_base/test/` when explicit partition alignment is preferred,
* use `*_human_value_labels_2ids.json` or `*_human_value_labels_2ids_reformatted.json` for benchmark-style supervised learning and evaluation,
* use `*_human_value_labels.json` or `*_human_value_labels_reformatted.json` for explanation-oriented inspection and qualitative analysis,
* use the shared `guid` field to align event records with human-value annotation records.

## Original and Reformatted Files

The reformatted files are provided for convenience and do not define a different dataset split or annotation standard. They reorganize the same released content into more normalized structures.

In all reformatted files, unit types are consistently represented in lowercase as:

* `article`
* `subevent`
* `bce`
* `sce`

where:

* `bce` corresponds to the original `behavior_chains`
* `sce` corresponds to the original `story_narratives`

Users who prefer the original structure can use the non-reformatted files. Users who want flatter and more standardized formats may use the reformatted files.

The unified and partition-specific event-base files follow the same principle: the train/dev/test versions do not define different event content, but provide the corresponding released event records organized according to the NEVU partition assignments.

## Contents of the Current Release

The current release is constructed from the NEVU data used in the paper after removing all records associated with the 350 protected GUIDs.

The event-base records are provided in two organizational forms:

* a unified collection under `event_base/event_base.json` and `event_base/event_base_reformatted.json`;
* explicit train/dev/test collections under `event_base/train/`, `event_base/dev/`, and `event_base/test/`.

The partition-specific event-base files are constructed from the train/dev/test GUID assignments of the full human-value annotation data under `total/`.

The human-value annotations are organized according to the train/dev/test partitions under `total/` and `sub/`.

Additional preprocessing for the public release remains consistent with the previous release:

* In `event_base.json`, some internal metadata fields are removed.
* In the human-readable human-value annotation files, only the public annotation fields such as `confidence` and `explanation` are retained.
* Reformatted files are additionally provided for easier parsing and more standardized downstream use.

## Protected Blind-Evaluation Data

The current release excludes 350 protected GUIDs and their corresponding annotations.

Protected instances are removed by `guid` from:

* the unified released `event_base/` data,
* the train/dev/test event-base files,
* the train/dev/test files under `total/`,
* the train/dev/test files under `sub/`,
* the released majority-accepted reference subset.

Because some sampled experimental subsets overlap with these protected GUIDs, the current public `sub/` files are not the complete sampled data used for the reported experiments.

The complete protected annotations and associated materials will be released after the blind evaluation period ends in **January 2027**.

## Notes

The `total/` and `sub/` directory names follow the subset terminology used in the paper.

The unified event-base files provide all currently shareable event records in a single collection. For convenience, the same records are also distributed into train/dev/test event-base files according to the GUID assignments of the full annotation partitions under `total/`.

The event-base train/dev/test files therefore align directly with the corresponding `total/` partitions. The `sub/` files remain fixed sampled annotation subsets and can be linked to the appropriate event records through the shared `guid` field.

The reformatted files preserve the same released annotation or event content as their corresponding original-format files while reorganizing it for easier use.

If exact backward compatibility with earlier parsing scripts is important, use the original-format files. If easier loading and more uniform field naming are preferred, use the reformatted files.# NEVU_Dataset
